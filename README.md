# VVVVVV, but it's made in Pygame

Exactly what it sounds like. I'm too lazy to go over all the detail but all the code is commented so hopefully that helps.
If you want to add a new stage to the game, add a new level object to `levels.vvvvvv`, and it will automatically appear in both the main game and the editor (via one of the function keys)
